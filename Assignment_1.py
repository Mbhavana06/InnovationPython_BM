 #Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and make sure their data types are invited differently. Like one is int, another one is float and last one is string.

a = 3; b = 5.2; c='Consultadd'

 #Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.
x = 2+b
y= 6
temp = x
x=y
y=temp

#Swap two numbers using third variable as result name and do the same task without using any third variable:

t=7
s=8
t=t^s
s=t^s
t=t^s
print(s)
print(t)

#Write a program to print the value given by the user by using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
# for version 3.x
a=input("Enter something")
print(a)
#for version 2.x
a = raw_input("Enter something")
print(a)

#Write a program to complete the task given below:
# Ask user to enter any 2 numbers in between 1􏰔-10 and add both of them to another variable call z.
 #Use z for adding 30 into it and print the final result by using variable result.

Var1=int(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10"))
Var2=int(input("Enter a number between 1 to 10"))
z=Var1+Var2
z+=30

# Write a program to check the data type of the entered values. HINT: Printed output should say 􏰔 The input value data type is : int􏰕float􏰕string􏰕etc
